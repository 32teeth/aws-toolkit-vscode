## Welcome to the Consolas Private Beta!

Thank You for participating in the Private Beta program for Consolas (a placeholder name). We are excited to share what we've been working on and hear your thoughts.

### What to expect

Now that you've installed the toolkit build, please ensure that the toolkit is connected to your AWS account. For help with adding your credentials, visit
the Visual Studio Code toolkit [documentation on account linking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/establish-credentials.html).

Consolas is already enabled for this toolkit, meaning suggestions will appear as your type or you can explicitly request a suggestion using [ALT C in windows and linux] or
[Option C in Mac].
If at any point you'd like to change or pause Consolas, you can find options in Settings > Extensions > AWS Toolkit. Based on your code and your settings configurations, Consolas can include suggestions that may be subject to an open source license.
For more information on our Private Preview Terms of Service, please refer to the document we've provided via email.

Additional questions? Email: consolas-feedback@amazon.com

### How to share feedback

The Consolas team at AWS is extremely excited to hear your feedback and grateful for your participation.
Throughout the program, we'll be sending links to surveys as a way to collect feedback and may reach out to you individually with follow-up questions. We will
also be sharing a private document for your personal feedback where you can share more elaborate feedback, paste code samples, etc.

We'd love to hear all of your thoughts, good and bad. If something is working differently than what you expected, helps you with your work, or makes you feel
strongly - please share! Although solution suggestions are welcome, there's no need to include what you'd like to see instead.

If you have any questions or concerns throughout this program, please feel free to send a mail directly to consolas-feedback@amazon.com.
If you have feedback in-between surveys or don't want to add it to the quip doc, please feel free to send a mail to consolas-feedback@amazon.com and
someone from our team will aim to respond within two business days.

### Some important legal reminders

-   The initial Consolas beta program is under NDA. You may not discuss any aspect of the beta (for example, the output, features, functionality, or documentation)
    with anyone not authorized by AWS.
-   This means that you may not use Consolas beta output (for example, code recommendations) as part of a service made available to third parties, and you may not
    distribute Consolas output (even if combined with other code) to third parties in either source or object form. In addition, you may not share the Consolas
    software with any third parties.

We will contact beta participants if these requirements change as the beta progresses. Please contact your companyâ€™s AWS administrators for more information.
